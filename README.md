# TTCC_Gag_Calculator
Find best attack strategy using OCR to identify levels. This was *heavily* inspired by multidragon's gag calculator.

## Notice
This is not completed yet. The OCR is still being tweaked and hasn't at the time of this posting been implemented. I plan on getting the gag logic close to finished before integrating the OCR into the script.

## What is data.json?
The JSON file is for storing all of the information about cog levels/gag damage/gag accuracy and may eventually store user settings (unsure how I want to implement that yet)

## When will this be done?
It's hard to give an accurate timeline this early on and as it's a side project it's not on my main priority list.
